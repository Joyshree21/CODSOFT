# CODSOFT
Welcome to the repository documenting my month-long machine learning internship journey at CODSOFT! Here, I share insights, projects, and learnings from this immersive experience.




### Assigned Task 1: Movie Genre Classification

**Project Description:**  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings will be employed, along with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

### Assigned Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Project Description:**  
In this project, we'll build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests. The model will be trained on a dataset containing information about credit card transactions to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

### Assigned Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

**Project Description:**  
The goal of this project is to develop a model for predicting customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, will be used. We'll experiment with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

### Assigned Task 4: Spam SMS Detection

**Project Description:**  
This project focuses on building an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings will be utilized, along with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. The model will help identify spam messages effectively.

### Assigned Task 5: Handwritten Text Generation

**Project Description:**  
For this project, we'll implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text. The model will be trained on a dataset of handwritten text examples, enabling it to generate new text based on the learned patterns. This project will explore the capabilities of RNNs in text generation tasks.



I have provided the respective project files along with the datasets to facilitate the development of these projects.
